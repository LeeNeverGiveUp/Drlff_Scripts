GARFfield force field parameter optimization framework, version 1.0
(c) Andres Jaramillo-Botero, ajaramil@caltech.edu (Caltech, 2010-2014)

1. DEFAULT SETTINGS
== GA specific ==
  -i='range' (Parameter interval)
  -s='maxiter' (Stopping criteria)
  -t=400 (Maximum GA iterations)
  -p=100 (GA Population size)
  -g='SSGA' (Population replacement strategy, steady-state with 10 percent population size replacement)
  -z=10 (SSGA population replacement percent)
  Mutation only (use -x to apply mutation and crossover operations)
  -m=1/5 (Mutation rate)
  -o=0.85 (Crossover rate = 0.85)

== Others ==
  -F='reaxc' (Force field)
  -I=500 (structure minimization steps)
  No hillclimbing (-c)
  No logfile (use -l to write a logfile)
  Energy minimization (use -f to use RMS force criterion instead)
  -e=MPE (Mean Percent Error)
  -d=None (Debug mode)
  -r=10 (Report period, in GA iterations)
  -u='electron' for eFF-ECP and 'real' otherwise (Units)
  Use regular Qeq/EEM solver for ReaxFF charges
  No low-gradient van der Waals correction (only reax/c)
  No periodic write of best force field (-w)
  Default to no Conjugate Gradient minimization in parabolic minima well (-G)
  Default structure optimization method is CG (-M)
  Fixed weights in training file (-W) 
  No mincap or safezone memory allocation in reax/c calculations (-S)
  No restarts (-R)
== User changes to default settings ==
>> -c = 50 (Use hillclimbing)

2. READING REAXFF FORCE FIELD FILE: ffield ... 





>> Read in 738 parameters from ffield

3. READING MOLECULAR GEOMETRY FILE: geo.new (bgf or xyz formats) ... 
>> Found 29 structures in geo.new
>> Found 29 restraints in geo.new
>> Finished reading structures from geo.new
>> Found 29 structures in geo.new

4. READING TRAINING SET FILE: trainset.in.new... 
WARNING: No valid charge training set data read from trainset.in.new.0!

>> Finished reading training set file trainset.in.new
>> There are 29 training cases in file trainset.in.new

5. READING PARAMETERS FILE: params ...
>> Finished reading parameters to optimize from file params
>> Read 5 parameters from params
6. START GA OPTIMIZATION (hill-climbing mode) ... good luck !!
